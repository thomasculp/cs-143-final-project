\begin{abstract}
Motivated by using existing infrastructure from institutional WiFi routers to
reduce costs of the eventual installation of 5G access points, fixed placement
of 5G APs is contrasted with dynamic, algorithmic placement. Goodness of
placement is measured by mean throughput and bandwidth in a room with typical
dimensions and population scenarios as would be expected in a Harvard dining
hall. Dynamic placement is found to have notable improvement over fixed AP
placement and may be an alternative to a large number of fixed 5G APs to
maintain coverage similar to that of WiFi.

\section{Introduction}
We are interested in realizing a 5G network at Harvard that can handle increasing bandwidth needs. If 5G access points were located at the current WiFi routers at Harvard, how far is this from optimal? An optimal 5G AP placement algorithm is needed to compare coverage given 5G access points in differing arrangements. 
    
Bandwidth demands continue to increase as the number of devices, the amount of data, and the demands of applications increase. According to a 2018 Cisco forecast, busy hour internet traffic will increase 5 fold between 2017 and 2022, mobile data traffic will increase 7 fold, and VR/AR traffic will increase 12 fold \cite{b1}. Increasing bandwidth demands drives the need for a 5G network. The implementation will require optimizing access point placement given real-world constraints.
    
The goal of this paper is to find optimal 5G AP placement that maximizes the evaluation metrics being  mean power and mean throughput. The approach is to run simulations based on a Harvard dining hall to determine optimal performance given varying scenarios. 

\section{Related Work}
	
Researchers have previously presented measured or theoretical link budget data and throughput for the 60-GHz band, including \cite{b2}, \cite{b3}, and \cite{b4}. Indoor propagation and parameters that affect propagation for the 60-GHz band have also been researched, including \cite{b5} and \cite{b6}. The 60-GHz radio channel represents a possibility for providing multigigabit per second wireless data transfers as required for 5G communication. 
	
In \cite{b7}, an optimization model is proposed to maximize the
sum of Euclidean distance of RSS vector among reference
points (RPs) within a limited area. In \cite{b8}, an indoor map system adoping vector graphic technology is used along with an opimtization model. Our contribution lies in an optimal placement algorithm for 5G AP placement as opposed to WiFi AP placement. 

\section{Simulation}

To determine the maximum performance of dynamic placement of APs, various
population density scenarios typical of the usage of a Harvard dining hall were
simulated. Two-dimensional $M\times N$ matrices $P_{ij}$ were created which give the number
of internet-enabled devices connected to APs. The indices of this matrix
correspond to the spatial layout of the dining hall. That is, $(i, j)$
are discrete coordinates which give a location on a grid which corresponds to a
physical place in a room and $P_{ij}$ gives the number of devices at that point
in the grid. The scenarios which $P_{ij}$ are
modeled after can be categorized as \textit{office hours, random clusters, and
future usage} (see Fig. \ref{grid}).

In the office hours scenario, one row of the matrix represented a large number of devices while the other rows were randomly generated at a lower bound. This is because during office hours at Kirkland dining hall, teaching fellows sit at one strip of tables so a large amount of students using devices congregate at those tables. In the random clusters scenario, each point on the grid was a randomly generated integer between 0 and 8, which is takes into account how many people fit around the different sized tables in the dining hall. In the future usage scenario, each point was a randomly generated number between 8 and 45, to represent a high-bandwidth scenario with 5 times the demand. 

Now, the task is to find the best discrete coordinates $C = \{(x_1, y_1), \dots,
(x_n, y_n)\}$ on the room's grid for $n$ routers to optimize mean power or mean
throughput for the devices in $P_{ij}$. Mean power is the mean over the set of
maximum power each device in $P_{ij}$ receives from any router. Mean throughput
is the mean over the set of throughputs each device in $P_{ij}$ receives. 
Each router gives throughput $T_{max} / m$ to each device connected to it, where
$T_{max}$ is a constant maximum throughput which is set to be equal across all
routers in the simulation and $m$ is the number of devices for which this router
is providing the maximum signal strength (i.e. $m$ devices have chosen to
connect to this router because they have the strongest connection to it out of
all the $n$ routers). Power is modeled by the Friis transmission equation,
\[p_r = p_t + d_r + d_t + 20\log_{10}(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d})\]
where $p_r$ is power received, $p_t$ is power transmitted, $d_{r(t)}$ is the
isotropic directivity of the receiver (transmitter), $\lambda$ is the
wavelength of the signal, and $d$ is the distance between the receiver and
transmitter. Thus, the only consideration for power here is free-space
transmission; absorption, reflection, and any interference is ignored in this
analysis.

The optimal choice of $C$ is determined by the following algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{$placement(P_{ij}, n, metric, attempts)$}
  \textbf{Require}: $maximize$, a function which takes a $metric$, population
  density, and initial guess for coordinates of a router $C$, and maximizes the
  metric locally (\texttt{scipy.optimize.minimize} was used for this purpose)
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $maxima[attempts]$ is an array containing the local maxima where
    $|maxima| = attempts$
    \For{$i=1\dots attempts$}
      \State $C[n]$ is the coordinates array for the routers, where $|C| = n$
      \For{$j=1\dots n$}
        \State $C[j] \gets$ (random(1, $M$), random(1, $N$))
      \EndFor
      \State $maxima[i] \gets maximize(P, C, metric)$
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{return} $max(maxima)$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm can be qualitatively described as choosing $attempts$ starting points randomly on the grid for the $n$ routers, using a maximization function to find a local maximum of $metric$ from those points, and then taking the maximum across the $attempts$ local maxima found. This is an approximation algorithm which ideally returns nearly the coordinates of the routers which maximize $metric$.

The metrics which can stand in for $metric$ are as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \textbf{Require}: $\forall device \in P$, $device.power = -\inf$.
    \caption{$power(P_{ij}, C)$}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \For{$i=1\dots M, j=1\dots N$}
            \For{$c \in C$}
                \State $p \gets \log_{10}{\frac{1}{|c - (i, j)|}}$
                \If{$p > device.power, device \in P_{ij}$}
                    \State $\forall device \in P_{ij}$, $device.power \gets p$
                \EndIf
            \EndFor 
        \EndFor
        \State \textbf{return} mean($\{device.power \mid device \in P\}$)
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
In $power$, the mean power over all devices in $P$ is returned, where the power is proportional to the log distance between the device at $(i, j)$ and the nearest router.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \textbf{Require}: $\forall device \in P$, $device.power = -\inf$. $\forall c \in C, c.count = 0$
    \caption{$throughput(P_{ij}, C)$}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \For{$i=1\dots M, j=1\dots N$}
            \For{$c \in C$}
                \State $p \gets \log_{10}{\frac{1}{|c - (i, j)|}}$
                \If{$p > device.power, device \in P_{ij}$}
                    \State $\forall device \in P_{ij}$, $device.power \gets p$
                    \State $\forall device \in P_{ij}$, $device.c \gets c$
                \EndIf
            \EndFor 
        \EndFor
        \For{$device \in P$}
            \State $device.c.count \gets device.c.count + 1$
        \EndFor
        \For{$c \in C$}
            \State $c.bandwidth \gets 1 / c.count$
        \EndFor
        \State \textbf{return} mean($\{device.c.bandwidth \mid device \in P\}$)
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
In $throughput$, each device connects to the router which it is nearest to. Then, the routers count their connections and the bandwidth they provide to their connections is the reciprocal of the number of connections (that is, their total bandwidth is set to unity for simplicity). Finally, the mean throughput is returned, which is the mean over the throughputs each device in $P$ receives.

\section{Conclusion}


\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.


\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
